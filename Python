#Check String
#To check if a certain phrase or character is present in a string, we can use the keyword in.
# Check if "free" is present in the following text:

# Strings
# Upper Case
# The upper() method returns the string in upper case:
a = "Hello, World!"
print(a.upper())

# Upper Case
# The lower() method returns the string in lower case:
a = "Hello, World!"
print(a.lower())

# Remove Whitespace
# Whitespace is the space before and/or after the actual text, and very often you want to remove this space.
# The strip() method removes any whitespace from the beginning or the end:
# not the middle
a = " Hello, World! "
print(a.strip()) # returns "Hello, World!"

# Replace String
# The replace() method replaces a string with another string:
# case-sensitive
a = "Hello, World!"
print(a.replace("H", "J"))

# Split String
# The split() method returns a list where the text between the specified separator becomes the list items.
# The split() method splits the string into substrings if it finds instances of the separator:
a = "Hello, World!"
print(a.split(",")) # returns ['Hello', ' World!']

# turns the identifier and cuts it there
a = "Hello, World!"
b = a.split("r")
print(b) # returns ['Hello, Wo', 'ld!']


# String Concatenation
# To concatenate, or combine, two strings you can use the + operator.
# Merge variable a with variable b into variable c:
a = "Hello"
b = "World"
c = a + b
print(c)

# To add a space between them, add a " ":
a = "Hello"
b = "World"
c = a + " " + b
print(c)

# can't combine strings with numbers
# the following does not work
age = 36
txt = "My name is John, I am " + age
print(txt)

# can combine using format()
# format() takes passed arguments, formats them, and places them in the string where {} are
# Use the format() method to insert numbers into strings:
age = 36
txt = "My name is John, and I am {}"
print(txt.format(age))

# The format() method takes unlimited number of arguments, and are placed into the respective placeholders:
quantity = 3
itemno = 567
price = 49.95
myorder = "I want {} pieces of item {} for {} dollars."

price = 49.95
myorder = "I want to pay {2} dollars for {0} pieces of item {1}."
print(myorder.format(quantity, itemno, price))


# Escape
# Escape Character
# To insert characters that are illegal in a string, use an escape character.
# An escape character is a backslash \ followed by the character you want to insert.
# An example of an illegal character is a " inside a string that is surrounded by "
# You will get an error if you use double quotes inside a string that is surrounded by double quotes:
txt = "We are the so-called "Vikings" from the north."

# To fix this problem, use the escape character \":
# The escape character allows you to use double quotes when you normally would not be allowed:
txt = "We are the so-called \"Vikings\" from the north."

# Other Excape Characters used in Python:
# \'	Single Quote	
# \\	Backslash	
# \n	New Line	
# \r	Carriage Return	
# \t	Tab	
# \b	Backspace	
# \f	Form Feed	
# \ooo	Octal value	
# \xhh	Hex value

# Evaluate Values and Variables
# bool() allows you to evaluate any value, and give you True or False in return,
# Evaluate a string and a number:
print(bool("Hello"))
print(bool(15))

# Evaluate two variables:
x = "Hello"
y = 15
print(bool(x))
print(bool(y))

# Most Values are True
# Almost any value is evaluated to True if it has some sort of content.
# Any string is True, except empty strings.
# Any number is True, except 0.
# Any list, tuple, set, and dictionary are True, except empty ones.
# The following will return True:
bool("abc")
bool(123)
bool(["apple", "cherry", "banana"])

# Some Values are False
# There are not many values that evaluate to False, except empty values, such as (), [], {}, "", the number 0, and the value None. And of course the value False evaluates to False.
# The following will return False:
bool(False)
bool(None)
bool(0)
bool("")
bool(())
bool([])
bool({})

# One more value, or object in this case, evaluates to False,
# and that is if you have an object that is made from a class
# with a __len__ function that returns 0 or False:
class myclass():
  def __len__(self):
    return 0
myobj = myclass()
print(bool(myobj))

# Functions can Return a Boolean
# You can create functions that returns a Boolean Value:
# Print the answer of a function:
def myFunction() :
  return True
print(myFunction())

# You can execute code based on the Boolean answer of a function:
# Print "YES!" if the function returns True, otherwise print "NO!":
def myFunction() :
  return True
if myFunction():
  print("YES!")
else:
  print("NO!")

# Python also has many built-in functions that return a boolean value,
# like the isinstance() function, which can be used to determine if an object
# is of a certain data type:
# Check if an object is an integer or not:
x = 200
print(isinstance(x, int)) # returns True


# Operators
# Python Operators
# Operators are used to perform operations on variables and values.
# In the example below, we use the + operator to add together two values:
print(10 + 5)

# Python divides the operators in the following groups:
# Arithmetic operators
# Assignment operators
# Comparison operators
# Logical operators
# Identity operators
# Membership operators
# Bitwise operators

# Arithmetic
# + - * /
# % modulus - gives remainder
# ** Exponentiation
# // Floor Division - rounds the result down to the nearest whole number

# Assignment Operators
# changes value of x:
# =	equal
# +=	if x += 3 then x is x + 3
# -=	if x -= 3 then x is x - 3
# *=	if x *= 3 then x is x * 3
# /=	if x /= 3	then x = x / 3	
# %=	if x %= 3	then x = x % 3	
# //= if x //= 3 then	x = x // 3	
# **=	if x **= 3 then	x = x ** 3
# Bitwise? - need to study this more
# &=	if x &= 3	then x = x & 3	- opposite of remainder, what u need to be whole
# |=	if x |= 3	then x = x | 3	
# ^=	if x ^= 3	then x = x ^ 3	
# >>=	if x >>= 3	then x = x >> 3	
# <<=	if x <<= 3	then x = x << 3

# Python Comparison Operators
# ==	Equal	x == y	
# !=	Not equal	x != y	
# >	Greater than	x > y	
# <	Less than	x < y	
# >=	Greater than or equal to	x >= y	
# <=	Less than or equal to	x <= y

# Python Logical Operators
# Logical operators are used to combine conditional statements:
# and 	Returns True if both statements are true	x < 5 and  x < 10	
# or	Returns True if one of the statements is true	x < 5 or x < 4	
# not	Reverse the result, returns False if the result is true	not(x < 5 and x < 10)

# Identity Operators
# Identity operators are used to compare the objects, not if they are equal, but if they are actually the same object, with the same memory location:
# is 	Returns True if both variables are the same object	x is y	
# is not	Returns True if both variables are not the same object	x is not y

# Membership Operators
# Membership operators are used to test if a sequence is presented in an object:
# in 	Returns True if a sequence with the specified value is present in the object	x in y	
# not in	Returns True if a sequence with the specified value is not present in the object

# Bitwise Operators
# Bitwise operators are used to compare (binary) numbers:
# & 	AND	Sets each bit to 1 if both bits are 1
# |	OR	Sets each bit to 1 if one of two bits is 1
#  ^	XOR	Sets each bit to 1 if only one of two bits is 1
# ~ 	NOT	Inverts all the bits
# <<	Zero fill left shift	Shift left by pushing zeros in from the right and let the leftmost bits fall off
# >>	Signed right shift	Shift right by pushing copies of the leftmost bit in from the left, and let the rightmost bits fall off

# List
# Lists are used to store multiple items in a single variable.
# Lists are one of 4 built-in data types in Python used to store collections of data, the other 3 are Tuple, Set, and Dictionary, all with different qualities and usage.
# Lists are created using square brackets
# Create a List:
thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
print(thislist)

# List Items
# List items are ordered, changeable, and allow duplicate values.
# List items are indexed, the first item has index [0], 
# the second item has index [1] etc.

# Ordered
# When we say that lists are ordered, it means that the items 
# have a defined order, and that order will not change.
# If you add new items to a list, 
# the new items will be placed at the end of the list.

# There are some list methods that will change the order, but in general: the order of the items will not change.
# Changeable
# The list is changeable, meaning that we can change, add, and remove items in a list after it has been created.

# Allow Duplicates
# Since lists are indexed, lists can have items with the same value:
# Lists allow duplicate values:
thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "apple", "cherry"]
print(thislist)

# List Length
# To determine how many items a list has, use the len() function:
# Print the number of items in the list:
thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
print(len(thislist))

# List Items - Data Types
# List items can be of any data type:
# String, int and boolean data types:
list1 = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
list2 = [1, 5, 7, 9, 3]
list3 = [True, False, False]

# A list can contain different data types:
# A list with strings, integers and boolean values:
list1 = ["abc", 34, True, 40, "male"]

# type()
# From Python's perspective, lists are defined as objects with the data type 'list':
<class 'list'>

# What is the data type of a list?
mylist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
print(type(mylist))
# <class 'list'>

# The list() Constructor
# It is also possible to use the list() constructor when creating a new list.
# Using the list() constructor to make a List:
thislist = list(("apple", "banana", "cherry")) # note the double round-brackets
print(thislist)

# Python Collections (Arrays)
# the 4 collection data types in Python:

# List - ordered and changeable. Allows duplicate members.
# Tuple - ordered and UNchangeable. Allows duplicate members.
# Set - unordered, unchangeable*, and unindexed. No duplicate members.
# Dictionary - ordered** and changeable. No duplicate members.
# *Set items are unchangeable, but you can remove and/or add items whenever you like.

# **As of Python version 3.7, dictionaries are ordered.
# In Python 3.6 and earlier, dictionaries are unordered.

# When choosing a collection type, it is useful to understand 
# the properties of that type. Choosing the right type for a particular data set 
# could mean retention of meaning, and,
# it could mean an increase in efficiency or security.

# Access List Items
# Access Items
# List items are indexed and you can access them by referring to the index number:
# Print the second item of the list:
thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
print(thislist[1])

# The first item has index 0.

# Negative Indexing
# means start from the end
# -1 refers to the last item, -2 refers to the second last item etc.

# Print the last item of the list:
thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
print(thislist[-1]) # returns cherry

# Range of Indexes
# Specify a range of indexes by specifying where to start and where to end the range.
# Return value will be a new list with the specified items.
# Return the third, fourth, and fifth item:
thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "orange", "kiwi", "melon", "mango"]
print(thislist[2:5]) # returns ['cherry', 'orange', 'kiwi']

# The search will start at index 2 (included) and end at index 5 (not included).
# First item has index 0.

# Leaving out the start value will start the range at the first item:
# This returns the items from the beginning to, but NOT including, "kiwi":

thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "orange", "kiwi", "melon", "mango"]
print(thislist[:4])

# Leaving out the end value will go on to the end of the list:
# This returns the items from "cherry" to the end:
thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "orange", "kiwi", "melon", "mango"]
print(thislist[2:])

# Range of Negative Indexes
# Specify negative indexes if you want to start the search from the end of the list:

# This returns the items from "orange" (-4) to, but NOT including "mango" (-1):
thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "orange", "kiwi", "melon", "mango"]
print(thislist[-4:-1])

# Check if Item Exists
# Determine if a specified item is present in a list, use the in keyword:
# Check if "apple" is present in the list:
thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
if "apple" in thislist:
  print("Yes, 'apple' is in the fruits list")


# Python - Change List Items
# Change Item Value
# Change the value of a specific item, refer to the index number:
# Change the second item:
thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
thislist[1] = "blackcurrant"
print(thislist)

# Change a Range of Item Values
# Change the value of items within a specific range, define a list with the new values, 
# and refer to the range of index numbers where you want to insert the new values:
# Change the values "banana" and "cherry" with the values "blackcurrant" and "watermelon":
thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "orange", "kiwi", "mango"]
thislist[1:3] = ["blackcurrant", "watermelon"]
print(thislist)

# If you insert more items than you replace, the new items will be inserted where you specified, and the remaining items will move accordingly:
# Change the second value by replacing it with two new values:
thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
thislist[1:2] = ["blackcurrant", "watermelon"]
print(thislist) - returns ['apple', 'blackcurrant', 'watermelon', 'cherry']

# The length of the list will change when the # of items inserted 
# does not match the number of items replaced.

# If you insert less items than you replace, 
# the new items will be inserted where you specified, 
# and the remaining items will move accordingly:

# Change the second and third value by replacing it with one value:
thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
thislist[1:3] = ["watermelon"]
print(thislist) - returns ['apple', 'watermelon'] and thislist removed banana and cherry

# Insert Items
# Insert a new list item, without replacing any of the existing values,
# we can use the insert() method.
# The insert() method inserts an item at the specified index:
# listname.insert(indexnum, item)

# Insert "watermelon" as the third item:
thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
thislist.insert(2, "watermelon")
print(thislist) - returns ['apple', 'banana', 'watermelon', 'cherry']
# list will now contain 4 items


# Python - Add List Items
# Append Items - to add an item to the end of the list
# Using the append() method to append an item:
thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
thislist.append("orange")
print(thislist) - returns ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry', 'orange']

# Insert Items
# Insert a list item at a specified index by using, use the insert() method.
# listname.insert(indexnum, list)

# Insert an item as the second position:
thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
thislist.insert(1, "orange")
print(thislist) - returns ["apple", "orange", "banana", "cherry"]
# list now has 4 items

# Extend List
# appends elements from another list to the current list

# Add the elements of tropical to thislist:
thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
tropical = ["mango", "pineapple", "papaya"]
thislist.extend(tropical)
print(thislist) - returns ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry', 'mango', 'pineapple', 'papaya']
# tropical got added to end of thislist

# Add Any Iterable
# extend() method does not have to append lists
# you can add any iterable object (tuples, sets, dictionaries etc.)

# Add elements of a tuple to a list:
thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
thistuple = ("kiwi", "orange")
thislist.extend(thistuple)
print(thislist) - returns ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry', 'kiwi', 'orange']

# Remove List Items
# Remove Specified Item - remove()
