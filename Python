# Random Number
# Python does not have a random() function to make a random number, but Python has a built-in module called random that can be used to make random numbers:
# Example
# Import the random module, and display a random number between 1 and 9:
# import random


print(random.randrange(1, 10))

# Strings
# single quotations are the same as double quotations
